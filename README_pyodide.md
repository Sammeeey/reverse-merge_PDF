- **stopped** because don't want to work on special cases, but rather focus on improvement of fundamental skills in JS, CSS, HTML

## idea
- wanted to deploy existing python application as web app which does most of the work on the client-side
  - so that I don't have high server cost, but all the relevant computation happens on user's computer
  - so that people can use app (for free) & I can practice web dev (not so relevant in this special use case, but should have been trial for potential future projects)
    - **client-side apps with basic, widely used features could be super useful for many people while I don't need to pay any relevant server cost for heavy computation (e.g. basic PDF tools, tools to convert file formats (e.g. using FFMPEG), ...)**
